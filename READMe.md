### Welcome to the Frontend Web Dev: Landing Page challenge! You will push your code here.

#### Description
In this project, we’ll demonstrate frontend web development skills by building a landing page using ReactJS. The page will beautifully convey company information while being responsive when viewed from both mobile phones and desktops. 

Required Components:

1. View the Figma file which your landing page will replicate:
   - https://www.figma.com/file/dF3v9Rd6OmJXpi3Lwti1CF/Mercor-Mockup.
   - The Figma contains mockups for what the landing page should look like on both desktop and mobile interfaces.
   - Assets like images can be accessed via the Figma by clicking on them and copying them as PNGs via Figma. Before accessing this functionality, you must       create your own Figma account.

2. Initialize a new React JS project:
   - Install necessary dependencies.
   - Set up your React components and styles to match the Figma mockup. 
   - Add assets like images from the Figma to the web page.
   - Add interactive elements, such as buttons and form inputs, to the web page. 

3. Test the project:
   - Ensure the responsiveness your web page by running it in a browser and adjusting screen size.
   - The web page should match the provided Figma mockup as closely as possible.
   - The web page should be optimized for performance and load quickly.

4. Deploy the application to a live domain using Heroku, AWS, or a similar service:
   - Sign up for a hosting service such as Heroku or AWS.
   - Follow the hosting service's instructions to deploy the application to a live domain.
   - Make sure to update the necessary configuration files and environment variables to reflect the live domain.

Optional Components:

1. Add animations:
   - Tastefully include animations as you see fit to the web page (for example, a loading icon).

2. Style and design your own form:
   - Create a form which fits the design aesthetic of the web page which collects a user’s name and email when they press the “Start Now” button.

Extensive documentation is required for all project submissions. Documentation should include clear and detailed instructions on how to set up the project on a local machine, including any necessary configuration steps and dependencies. 

Candidates who submit the best projects will be placed at companies recruiting for frontend web development roles and be featured on LinkedIn to Mercor's network of US recruiters.
